   * It is as if, etfsregister was not designed to show the registered device...
   *  However, accessing the etfsregistered device still results in a valid fd being returned
   * Unfortunatly, if the etfsregistered device's key, eg: /paws, is set to be the same thing
   * as makeonedevnode eg: /dev/paws, then the device will not show up in the list, for what I believe
   * to be because it has already found that device to exist there. *even though it does not show*.
   *
   * It seems that the function I am using here then, is used then not to simply display the name of the device
   * but also to register it. This would lead me to believe that I should use a some inner function to simply
   * add my paws to the list of /dev devices, but as I now know I can still acess the propper etfsregistered
   * device... I no longer care and will simply put the etfsregistered device in /paws while keeping the
   * makeonedevnode device within /dev/paws. I will then simply be sure to open just /dev */
